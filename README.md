# <h1>Week One Challenge</h1>
<br/>
<h2>My Task</h2> 
  <p>I have been given the task of changing the code of a clients web page to make it more accessible. Web pages which are accessible are more user friendly for deaf people as their readers are able to follow the code. The readers can locate the appropriate content within the page by reading the elements in the html. To make the webpage accessible I needed to change the non semantic elements to semantic elemetents. Examples of non semantic elements are "div" and "span". Examples of semantic elements are "article" and "form". To complete the task I need to locate the "div" elements in the html and change them to their semantic couterparts. When I have changed this, it will change the output unless I also alter the CSS code accordingly.</p>
  <br/>
  <h2>User Story</h2>
  <p>AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
</p>
  
  <h2>Acceptance Criteria</h2>
  
To achieve accessibility standards I need to ensure:

<li>Semantic HTML elements can be found throughout the source code</li>
<li>HTML elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning</li>
<li>Image and icon elements contain accessible alt attributes</li>
<li>Heading attributes fall in sequential order</li>
<li>Title elements contain a concise, descriptive title</li>

<h2>Resources</h2>
<p>To complete this task I refered to to code we made in our week one group project for class. I applied knowledge learnt in my 1-1 with Michelle, which achieved that outome I was looking for. (This was changing the "div class hero div" to "img id hero img" in the html and in the css changing ".hero" to "#hero".</p>)
