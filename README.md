# <h1>Week One Challenge</h1>
  <br/>
 <h2>My Task</h2> 
   <p>I have been given the task of changing the code of a clients web page to make it more accessible. Web pages which are accessible are more user friendly for people who are visually impaired as their text-to-speech devices are able to follow the code. The devices can locate the appropriate content within the page by reading the elements in the HTML. To make the webpage accessible I needed to change the non semantic elements to semantic elemetents within the code. To complete the task I need to locate the "div" elements in the HTML and change them to their semantic counterparts. When I have changed the HTML, I need to also alter the CSS code accordingly.</p>

 <h2>User Story</h2>
  
  <br/>
  
  >AS A marketing agency<br/>
     I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards<br/>
     SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines<br/>
  </p>
  
  <br/>
  
<h2>Acceptance Criteria</h2>

  <br/>
  
  <p>To achieve accessibility standards I need to ensure:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>Semantic HTML elements can be found throughout the source code</li>
    <li>HTML elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning</li>
    <li>Image and icon elements contain accessible alt attributes</li>
    <li>Heading attributes fall in sequential order</li>
    <li>Title elements contain a concise, descriptive title</li>
  </ul>
  
  <br/>

<h2>Resources</h2>

  <br/>
 
  <p>To complete this task I refered to HTML and CSS created for the group project in the first week of my Web Application class.<br/>
   I also applied knowledge learnt in my 1-1 tutoring session.<br/>
  
  <br/>

 <h2>Visual References</h2>
 
  <br/>

  <p>Here are 2 images for visual comparision. The first image is how the application looked when I was given it to work on. The second image is how it looks after I have completed the work. Apperance wise, the application should not change as my task is to bring it up to accessability standards.</p>

 <h2>Notes</h2>
  
  <br/>
  
  <p>In this part of my READ.ME page I include things which helped me to complete the project.</p>
  
  <br/>
  
  <ul>
   <li>Examples of non semantic elements are "div" and "span". Examples of semantic elements are "article" and "form".</li>
   <li>When changing "div class=hero div" to "img id=hero img" in the HTML and in the CSS changing ".hero"  to "#hero".</p>
